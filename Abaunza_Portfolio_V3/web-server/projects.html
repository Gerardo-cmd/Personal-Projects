                            <p>This is the traditional hangman game. It will fetch a random two words from an API and will return the words as asteriks 
                                so that the user can guess letter by letter and eventually, the words. 
                                If the user guesses a correct letter then the letter will show up in place of the asterik in every occurence of it in both of the words. 
                                If the user makes an incorrect guess then the number of guesses the user has left will decrease by one.
                                The user wins the game by either figuring out the word within the alloted number of guesses or fails the game by running out 
                                of guesses without guessing the words. If the user types in a letter that has already been guessed, then nothing will happen. Please note that this app is not mobile friendly.

                            <p>The user can add todos and remove them as they wish. There are checkboxes next to each todo 
                                that the user can check to signify if it is completed or not. At the top of the website one
                                can find a search bar that will filter the todos based on what the user types in by looking for 
                                a matching title. The user will also be told how many todos are left based on how many unfinished 
                                (unchecked) todos exist.
                                There is also an option to only display the incompleted todos.

                                alphabetically, by last edited, or by last created. Additionally, the notes can be searched by their title by using the filter notes search bar.

                                This application allows the user to input any location and recieve the current forecast for that location!
                                It will include the temperature it is outside, what temperature it feels like, the humidity, and the visibility.
                                It accomplishes this by using two APIs which are linked to in the Weather App's About page.

                                Users must sign up and create an account by inserting their name, email, and creating a new password.
                                This application allows the user to save their own recipes as well as edit them and delete them.
                                Users are also able to sort their recipe by type (which is the default sorting method), alphabetically, and by last created.
                                Currently working on a feature that allows users to share recipes with each other.
