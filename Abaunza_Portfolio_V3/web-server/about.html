                        <h2>Computer Science Background</h2>
                        <p>I am a rising senior Computer Science student at George Mason University. 
                        It is there that I learned Java, Python, and C as well as various other topics such as agile methods, reading assembly, data structures, database concepts, and formal methods and logic. 
                        Additionally, I am self taught in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and am currently learning React. I have coded for over three years now and love the challenge. 
                        I currently reside in Centreville, Virginia and am currently looking to intern remotely or anywhere in the Northern Virginia and DC Metropolitan Area as a front-end developer
                        or software engineer!
                        </p>

                        <h2 style = "margin-bottom: 0.1rem;">General Information About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                        I was born in Northern Virginia and lived around the area my whole life.
                        I enjoy weightlifting and hiking as hobbies and have been weightlifting for over 4 years now. I enjoy having fun with friends playing video games, watching movies, and going on walks.
                        I currently work as a swim instructor and a supervisor at Lifetime and have worked there for over two years.
